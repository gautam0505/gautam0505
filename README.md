Hi, I'm Gautam, a B.E. student in IT with a passion for web development. I'm currently focused on learning React and expanding my knowledge of frontend technologies. With experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have a solid foundation in creating engaging and dynamic user interfaces.

My eagerness to learn extends beyond frontend development. I'm always striving to broaden my understanding of backend technologies, with a particular interest in building scalable and efficient web applications.

In addition to my studies, I'm also open to freelance opportunities where I can apply my skills and continue to learn from new challenges. Feel free to reach out to me at gautamkuamrjha0505@gmail.com.
